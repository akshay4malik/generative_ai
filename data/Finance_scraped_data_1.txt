[Music] welcome to portfolio rescue our new show here at the compound i'm your host ben carlson this is the show where we're gonna be answering questions directly from you the viewer every week we're gonna be here live thursdays uh just a little background on why we started this show when you produce content for a living and you build up an audience eventually you're bound to get some feedback that's the best and worst part about the internet sometimes it's positive sometimes it's negative but because we produce financial content we also receive a ton of questions asking us for our opinions there's really no handbooks for this stuff when it comes to your finances so each week our inboxes are full of questions from people who listen to a podcast or watch these videos or read our blogs and sometimes these emails from people make us laugh sometimes they make us cringe sometimes they make us think sometimes they help us learn and one of the really cool parts is that people place their trust in us and they share this very detailed information with us so how much money they make how much they have saved what kind of stock options they have at work their retirement plan their investment strategies the financial problems they're having all this kind of stuff and we've come to realize hey wait a minute maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes because you can you can look at these questions and go wait how would i handle that situation or i've dealt with something like that did i do the right thing or what if something like this happens to me or what is this person thinking how could they how could they be so stupid so um we don't pretend to have all the answers here um as with most things in life there's there's a lot of gray area here there's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances um and i want to get this out of the way too that this this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for advanced decisions as we have to say in the legalese but um we've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context some perspective and some opinions based on our experience uh we just want to make help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions so that's what the show is going to be each week i'm going to be here uh if you have a question for us email us askthecompoundshow gmail.com now real quick on some of the format of the show before we get started here we get a wide range of questions everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stock picking to crypto to saving retirement uh everything in between and i have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now i've been doing our podcast animal spirits for four or five years i have a cfa i have an mba i'm not trying to brag here just laying it out there my resume but i don't pretend to be an expert on every single financial concept out there so each week i'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where i'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert donate domain knowledge on a topic that i don't so um without further ado that's how it's going to work duncan let's do the first question cool uh hey everyone we we see you in the chat here thanks for tuning in today like ben said this is uh this was kind of like a secret we didn't promote it at all so it's cool to see so many of you already uh already showing up there okay so first up the question is i recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained two percent in the previous year he has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100 fixed income he's in his mid-30s and these are his retirement funds i told him that he should have the majority of his stocks his money in stocks with this kind of time horizon i'm not an advisor so i want to be careful about advice but what's the best way for him to do this a one-time move to stocks or index funds move his money in chunks over the course of the next year any advice would be appreciated this is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk i should say uh so it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative because last year the stock market was up almost 20 percent crypto was up an ungodly amount uh even bonds were up so two percent is pretty tough to stomach so there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk one could be they just don't understand how the markets work uh maybe they're too scared maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here uh maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets or they've already lost money and they're scarred from the past the way that i look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital and time so you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind the problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works um so if this person is scared of losing money which it it can happen um i i wanted to read something from one of my favorite books it's called where the customer's yachts it's one of the best titled books of all time as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read um ever written it is written in 1940. now that's a that's a pretty short list of funny investment books but um just wanted to read this one passage because i think it really ties into this question like all of life's rich emotional experiences the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature art cannot convey an inexperienced girl what it is like to be a wife and a mother there are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by either words or pictures nor can any description that i might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they used to own it's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets so you could try to educate this person and i think you that can help but since no one teaches this stuff it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework so no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jogged in their life and runs a marathon you have to sort of ease into it and train and get better and so the way i view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with right so i think you can start by asking some questions like to this person how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile um and do you understand how the stock market works and if this person doesn't there's no shame in that i think there is a great way to learn and one of my favorite books on this topic uh simple wealth inevitable wealth by nick murray is a classic one of the best books i've ever read on getting a long-term mindset and thinking through investing in the stock market now if you want to buy this book for your friend you can actually get it on amazon you have to go to nickmarie.com that's m-u-r-r-a-y because nick sells these books himself he he printed it on his own and nick is a not a businessman he's a business comma man so that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this uh what do we think duncan yeah no it sounds good i've got to read that one i haven't read that one yet it's a classic it sounds like what you're talking about is all about the very idea of risk tolerance right just figuring out what someone's willing to put however yeah it's your it's how much risk you need to take how much you want to take and how much you can actually accept and that's a tough balance to strike but obviously this person with decades ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk all right uh question two what do we got okay so uh for this question uh we have i'm a 48 year old single male with around 840 thousand dollars saved that is 55 traditional ira 35 roth and 10 taxable i'm currently maxing out my roth 401k roth ira and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year next year will be the first year i will make significantly more of in the roth ira income limit of 125 thousand dollars what do i do with the six thousand dollar roth ira contribution going forward and then they go they go through they have a little more detail and we'll get okay uh first of all good problem to have this person's income is rising they're saving a lot so kudos to you i would love to be able to talk about roth iras with you but um i actually have an expert here my personal tax consultant our cfo real real holdsworth management bill sweet who i believe has roth ira tattooed on his back like ben affleck has with the dragon um so we're going to bring bill in to kind of help us here with this one on the tax side roth king gentlemen it's true guilty as charged so i want to start single male is winning the game ben you're absolutely right my man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up and that's fantastic given where he is in life so his question what do you do with the 6000 he's hit the roth ira direct contribution limit to answer this ben let me ask you a question let's fast forward ten years let's say that i could just gift you ten thousand dollars in one of three accounts one is in a traditional array subject to income tax on distribution the second is in a brokerage account not qualified so you gotta pay capital gains and then let's say i give you ten thousand dollars in a roth ira which one do you choose and why well i'm cheating here because i already have the answers because in recent years you talked me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a roth so um i'm going to take the roth without having to phone a friend right and the idea there is that do yourself a future self a favor now which is if you can get all that that gain the the 6 000 let's say rule of seven grows to 12 000 in 10 years and then grows to 24 000 god willing in 20 years etc if you can get all that gain tax free why wouldn't you do that and this taxpayer this single male is doing this right he's max funding a roth 401k so let me skip forward to the solution uh at 140 000 of agi you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a roth ira but you can do this really really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ad nauseum called a backdoor roth ira the mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional ira and then in your tax return you do not elect to take a tax deduction this taxpayer single male is above the income limit he couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to so every year that he does that he can dump the money in 6 000 into traditional ira that's his contribution limit immediately then convert that asset to a roth there is no income limit on roth ira conversions that's the backdoor roth ira process the irs chief counsel signed off on this about two three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed but if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it there's no irs regulation and the top attorney at the irs comes out and says this is cool that's a strategy that we can all deploy no however that oh sorry go ahead so the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax-free that's the idea if you're going to save the money anyway why not look to sort of help your future self back to that question we we brought in before so just two other quick points i want to make on this topic number one is that congress is making noise about shutting this this this contribution and so this might be over unfortunately beginning january 1st 2022 and that door is going to go away possibly yep yep this is part of the house wins and means proposal committee budget that came out uh in september and yeah this is targeted we'll see if it survives the committee stuff this is a hot potato right now you'll pull up the wall street journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on uh with the budget reconciliation but yes this could be something that goes away next year okay all right duncan what's the next one okay so uh next up we have a real estate one uh once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k roth ira is real estate the next best option i've always been told that owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing do you guys believe this still holds true if so is real estate investing still a viable option these days with bloated home prices and then they go and give us the the context of who they are i understand why people would think this you're you're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make you see these these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation that's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate and if you're doing rental properties you can potentially increase the income over time right like those are the pros the cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state that's tough so do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation and and the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals so i know that there are individuals who can do this i would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff there's a lot of costs involved and it's probably not going to be easy and one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year yeah you're running a business that's it i agree so not only do we as a firm advise folks on some of these decisions but i also play this game like i'm a client too i own a five unit rental property in suburban new york and they're really two big things i want to see on this number one is that i think the listener's right i think over the long term real estate is an awesome long-term investing opportunity but like everything in investing it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay and so the listeners thinking about this i think soberly ben i think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market but the reality is real estate is local and so if you can find a local opportunity if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to to help you out that's a great thing to jump in on if you're focused on let's say 10 years or more we all know the guy whose dad bought a house in brooklyn in 1975 for five thousand dollars right he sold it last year for a half million therefore his return was 100x no it wasn't along the way ben you're right he had to replace a roof at some point for twenty thousand dollars the plumbing had to be replaced taxes uh are well plus in your situation how do you find tenants every year so it's rough and that means for me putting it out on craigslist and if that doesn't work i need to go find a broker right and then i owe them a first month's rent that chews into my net operating profit there in year one meaning every tenant i sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year right and ben i'm glad you brought that up because it's work real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff which again eats in your profit i have five tenants that means i have five clients that i need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their their lease there are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random tuesday and if my plumber's not picking up the phone and there's water pouring all over my floor it's up to me to get off my butt get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed so my advice is be prepared to run a business this is a part-time job pay attention to cost and less about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul yeah all right uh one more bonus question for you guys that i'm going through personally this is not coming from a listener this is not coming from you this is me um i've had some issues with my landscape recently they're having i feel for them because they're having a labor shortage uh they have been communicating with me very well so we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying every single summer these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem um surprisingly they said the trees are getting too much water i don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about but sure too much water your car's getting too much gas ben so yeah so in may they told us uh we're gonna replace these trees before we got some nice birch trees we're gonna bring back it's gonna be beautiful we'll give you an estimate we'll put them in uh weeks go by we don't hear anything i reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me so i said you know what fine and guess what the trees that were back there came back to life miraculously we had a lot of rain this summer uh fast forward to september i see some tracks going into the back of the house looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as i get home from work asked my wife what's going on she said i don't know i was gone all day we go back in the backyard the new trees are there look gorgeous beautiful they never told us they send me the bill uh we're talking close to two thousand dollars worth of trees here now wow the kids have already gone out and named each tree it's uh you know they they like their own tree uh what sort of recourse do i have here do i complain do i suck it up uh do i ask for uh some sort of uh like long-term guarantee on these trees what do i do do i do i pay it in full and and just stop my feet i'd ask how you how they value the trees you know how they came up with that price well there's a cape ratio on the trees based on the number of leaves and uh so i think i do i just suck it up here these are ben carlson problems do you know how to solve this problem do you know do you know where this guy lives do you know where his uh his business address is i know it's located yes i would i would go straight biblical you go eye for eye for a tooth girl you take his and that's how we do it around here that's that's been carlson's style that's right that sounds that sounds great until i don't know how to use power tools because i'm useless and uh you see you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night i would be on the on the ground and looking at it and it's no fun what to do i'm not sure it's worth my negative four thousand dollars of depreciation every year okay those trees are going to grow over time though this is a great lesson in compounding they're going to get bigger so um i think i got to steal it and then you can sell them as lumber i was going to say nft the the solution is staring us right in the face guys thank you to bill and duncan for helping out today um if you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today feel free to leave them in the comments below i go through and read every one of them even from the haters who call me elitist i swear um i personally read everyone if you remember if you have a question for the show askthecompoundshow gmail.com we're going to be going over these every week every thursday and who knows will come next week with me for an expert and we'll see you next week [Music] you
